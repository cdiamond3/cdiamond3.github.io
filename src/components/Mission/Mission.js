            üö® OUR GOAL üö® Our goal with The IIC is create an ongoing community
            driven story arch that will span from collection to collection! With
            a rich lore and storyline we can take our infants ANYWHERE! We are
            committed to our community and doing things naturally! We want our
            growth to be real and genuine! The main purpose of The IIC is not
            only to foster an AMAZING community but to also give back to those
            in need! 10% of each phase sales will go to The Children's Miracle
            Network, that works directly with Children's Hospitals! üìì COLORING
            BOOKS üìì - With such a rich backstory and almost unlimited amount of
            characters to choose from we will be creating our very own IMMATURE
            INFANT COLORING BOOKS! - They will be made from YOUR infants and
            aside from each token holder receiving a book we will be donating 1
            book for each holder to the Children's Hospital where we will
            personally hand them out to kids! - We will release a book for each
            of our future collections! ( Right now we have TWO additional
            collections planned )! Thank you all from the bottom of our hearts!
